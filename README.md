A to-do list app built as an AngularJS lab for Grand Circus. Design as done to provided visual specifications and the build adhered to the specs below.


## Build Specs

### ANGULAR TODO LIST LAB PART 1

Task: Create an Angular application that displays to-dos.

What does the application do?

1. Displays a hard-coded list of todos.

#### Build Specifications:

1. Every Angular component must be in a separate script file.
2. Must include a module called “todoApp”.
3. Must include a controller called “TodoController.”
4. The controller must add an array of sample todo objects to the view model. Each todo object has “task” (string) and “completed” (boolean). Include a mix of complete and incomplete items.
5. The ngRepeat directive must be used.
6. The ngClass directive must be used to add a “completed” class for completed todos.
7. The ngIf directive must be used to remove the button “complete” button for completed todos.
8. “x” buttons, “complete” buttons, the two inputs, and the “Add” button are all non-functional for now. Add them to the HTML and style them. We will make them work in the next lab.
